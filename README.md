# COVID-19 Dashboard
Covid was/is a really bad thing. <br> 
But to understand how bad it really was/is let us analyse the data.<br>
This Project is structured in two parts.

1. SQL Data Exploration
2. Tableau Visualization

The main goal of this project is to tell a story. A bad atory about a pandemic, where a lot of people died.<br>
The story consists of data. This project takes this data and visualize it, so that everybody can read and understand that story.

**The dataset i'm using:**<br>
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths <br>
*The version of the dataset i'm using may be not the latest*

## 1. SQL Data Exploration<br>
So the first thing we do is gonna be data exploration with SQL.<br>
We will query the data, because we need this later for our tableau visualization.<br>
**Our Queries:**
- Global data
- Total deaths per continent
- Percent population infected per country
- Percent population infected

## 2. Tableau Visualization
