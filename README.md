# PortfolioProject_COVID-19
Covid was/is a really bad thing. <br> But to understand how bds it really was let us analyse the data. <br>
This Project is structured in four parts.

1. SQL Data Exploration
2. Tableau Visualization
3. SQL Data Cleaning
4. Correlation in Python

The main goal of this project is to tell a story. A bad atory about a pandemic, where a lot of people died.<br>
The story consists of data. This project takes this data and visualize it, so that everybody can read and understand that story.

**The dataset i'm using:**<br>
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths <br>
*The version of the dataset i'm using may be not the latest*

## 1. SQL Data Exploration<br>
So the first thing we do is gonna be data exploration with SQL.<br>
We will query the data, because we need this later for our tableau visualization.<br>
**Our Queries:**
- Global data
- Total deaths per continent
- Percent population infected per country
- Percent population infected

We gonna save each query as a excel file and use it in Tableau Pubic.

## 2. Tableau Visualization
